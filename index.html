				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>I'm currently an undergraduate at Northeastern University (graduating May 2023), studying
					data science as my major
					along with mathematics as my minor. Throughout my time at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, I've
					gained an increasingly strong and experienced background in not only computer science, but also
					math. Post graduation, I hope to further develop these skills through a career in data science.
					For
					now, I'm currently on the lookout for a co-op position before my Junior year spring semester to
					gain valuable experience in the industry.</p>

				<p>Outside of academic and professional affairs, I love to enjoy and explore life with my friends and
					family. As for interests, I pass time by playing guitar, watching TV shows,
					skateboarding / playing basketball with friends, or playing video games. I particularly enjoy
					developing my hobbies, as seeing my skills grow over time is very rewarding.</p>

					</ul>
					<p> For my Foundations of Data Science course (DS 3000), my group and I created a report in
						Jupyter
						Notebook detailing
						our findings in regards to predicting the expected popularity of a piece of music. We used a
						Spotify Dataset from Kaggle that included approximately 160,000 songs, as well
						as a scraped dataset from a listing of the top 100 most streamed songs on Spotify. Using various
						Python libraries and toolkits,
						we cleaned and visualized the data, and fit it to both regression and classification models.
						After optimizing our models, we found that on our test sets, the best regressor (K-nearest
						Neighbors) had an R<sup>2</sup> of .3088, and the best classifier (LinearSVC) had an accuracy of
						78.43%.
					</p>
					<p>In the report, my contributions involved all of the written portions (excluding the executive
						summary), as well as all of the code relating to the classification models. I also created two
						of the visualizations, in addition to improving upon the other three visuals and their analyses.
						As an example, you can see one of my visualizations below:</p>

					<iframe frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~arezab213/1.embed"></iframe>

					<blockquote> A 3D scatter plot can be used to see how Spotify's popularity metric
						behaves with 2 values: the year released, and the amount of streams. A color scale reflects the
						rank, with higher ranking
						songs having lighter shades, and lower ranking songs having darker shades. From this
						visualization, it can be seen that the popularity value is a very time-based variable, as it has
						a strong correlation to the
						release year of the song. Thus, by Spotify's metric, a song can have a high rank with many total
						streams, but if the streams are not recent, then the popularity score will not be as similarly
						high.

						<h3 class="major">EasyAnimator</h3>

						<p>In my Object-Oriented Design class (CS 3500), I pair-programmed a GUI application with my
							friend Alex Les in Java. Our program is able to read text-based input files (many of which
							were
							given to us)
							to build an animation of
							simple shapes, including rectangles, ellipses, and plus shapes. </p>

						<p>Animations can be displayed
							visually or textually outputted through tables of animation frame data. In our interactive
							visual animations, standard playback and speed controls are supported, along with toggles
							for looping,
							discrete frame playing, as well as an outline mode for shapes. Users can also insert slow
							motion commands in the input files to create intervals of slow motion in the animation.
							Lastly, our application can also export the animations in SVG code to be played in a
							browser.</p>

						<p>Throughout our project, we
							maintained a robust Model-View-Controller (MVC) design, documented our code throughout, and
							thoroughly tested each component
							of the application. In a later part of our assignment, we created fully functional adapters
							to accomodate for additional view components received from other students' projects. This
							involved little to no
							changes in our original code: a direct result of our strong program design (minimal
							coupling,
							interface segregation, single class responsibility, etc). </p>
						<p>Below are some videos demonstrating our application.</p>

						<blockquote> This video shows an animation portraying how the bubble sort algorithm works.
							Unlike the previously shown big-bang animation, this input file for this animation was made

						<blockquote> Lastly, we made the input file for this animation by
							hand, creating an animation that morphs through the flags of Scandinavia. </blockquote>

						<p>A portion of the flag animation's input
							file is shown below, to give a sense of what our application reads in order to build the
							animations. The position, dimensions, and RGB values of the top left rectangle over time are
							listed:</p>

							<h3 class="major">Space Invaders</h3>
							<p>I developed a simple game of Space Invaders for my Fundamentals of Computer Science II
								class (CS 2500), also in Java. The player can use the arrow keys to move side to side
								and the spacebar
								for firing from the spaceship. </p>
							<p>At most, the invaders can have 10 shots fired on screen at any moment, and the player is
								also limited at a maximum of 3 shots on screen. Once all the invaders are hit, the
								player has won. However, if the player gets hit by an invader's bullet, the game ends in
								a
								loss.</p>
